This program is created by group sw2a400b from Aalborg University, Denmark. Because this is a university project,
it is created for the sole purpose of programming and problem solving, which are the key elements of the project of
the second semester. The program is therefore not created for any form of business and is only to be used in a school
project oriented matter.

The program is therefore created to achieve a greater knowledge regarding problem solving with a software solution and
in general object oriented programming, which has been prioritized.
